# This is a pseudo code file for Merge Robotics, 2020, Infinite Recharge
# This is task M - > Sample Mouse Clicks by Pixel. 
# We are going to continue towards our objective of a tool for season kickoff
# This pseudo file will allow us to determine a pixel color by clicking
# on it.  The purpose is to help calibration of the color filter.
# Using web searches for python and pixel color with a mouse, create your own
# code to deliver this capacity.

# coords of pixel and numbers for colour (depedning on bgr or hsv
# numpy is like spreadsheet -switch x and y to y (row) and x (column)
# have to calibrate to what range of yellow camera sees-change hsv range
#USE THIS TOOL TO CALIBRATE
